All citizens interested in winning a cash prize were welcomed to spend two days casting their rods and hopes into the water to try and earn the most points through catching seasonal fish that had recently and temporarily migrated into the waters around Los Santos. To make things as fair as possible the Mayor declared that the fishing competition would be split across two days to give all citizens of all work schedules an opportunity to participate.</description></item></channel></rss>
