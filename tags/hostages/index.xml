She recounted that she was kidnapped, ziptied, and held hostage by an unknown assailent who took her to a grocery store and proceeded to rob the store. After the situation, Ms. Nova stated that the LSPD failed to offer any additional aid after releasing her from the zipties. She was forced to procure a vehicle to vacate the scene and seek out medical care.</description></item></channel></rss>
