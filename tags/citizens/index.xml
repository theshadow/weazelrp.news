Quirky, shy, and always willing to help Arturo Campo was on a journey tod find his way home and we here at Weazel News felt it was a journey worth sharing. We first met Arturo, a thirty-six (36) year old Los Santo&amp;rsquo;s native, in the tent city under the Olympic Freeway. He was sitting in a camping chair and mostly seemed just excited to speak with someone.</description></item><item><title>Homelessness Plagues the City</title><link>/posts/homelessness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/homelessness/</guid><description>At the beginning of this piece Weazel News wanted to learn more about the state of homelessness in the Los Santo&amp;rsquo;s. We wanted to understand what brought the people to the state of being homeless and how the city could step up as a community and help solve the problem. What we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect is the wide range of answers and opinions on the topic as well as the stories we heard from all walks of life.</description></item></channel></rss>
