All citizens interested in winning a cash prize were welcomed to spend two days casting their rods and hopes into the water to try and earn the most points through catching seasonal fish that had recently and temporarily migrated into the waters around Los Santos. To make things as fair as possible the Mayor declared that the fishing competition would be split across two days to give all citizens of all work schedules an opportunity to participate.</description></item><item><title>Gone in 60 Seconds, Los Santos Style</title><link>/posts/racing-comes-to-los-santos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/racing-comes-to-los-santos/</guid><description>There was a lot of demand in the city for an opportunity for those with a lead foot and a desire to have their hair blown back for the citizenry to race.

Quirky, shy, and always willing to help Arturo Campo was on a journey tod find his way home and we here at Weazel News felt it was a journey worth sharing. We first met Arturo, a thirty-six (36) year old Los Santo&amp;rsquo;s native, in the tent city under the Olympic Freeway. He was sitting in a camping chair and mostly seemed just excited to speak with someone.</description></item><item><title>Homelessness Plagues the City</title><link>/posts/homelessness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/homelessness/</guid><description>At the beginning of this piece Weazel News wanted to learn more about the state of homelessness in the Los Santo&amp;rsquo;s. We wanted to understand what brought the people to the state of being homeless and how the city could step up as a community and help solve the problem. What we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect is the wide range of answers and opinions on the topic as well as the stories we heard from all walks of life.</description></item></channel></rss>
