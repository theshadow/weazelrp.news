Earlier today Weazel News met up with Cassie Nova, cousin to Gia Nova, at the Elgin St. garage. She recounted that she was kidnapped, ziptied, and held hostage by an 
unknown assailent who took her to a grocery store and proceeded to rob the store. After the situation, Ms. Nova stated that the LSPD failed to offer any additional aid 
after releasing her from the zipties. She was forced to procure a vehicle to vacate the scene and seek out medical care. Ms. Nova was able to name police officer Lawson, 
but was unsure if that was the officer on the scene. Weazel News was unable to obtain comment on this story from the LSPD.
