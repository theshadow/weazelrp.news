At the beginning of this piece Weazel News wanted to learn more about the state of homelessness in the Los Santo's. We wanted to understand what brought the people to the state of being homeless and how the city could step up as a community and help solve the problem. What we didn't expect is the wide range of answers and opinions on the topic as well as the stories we heard from all walks of life. Our journey began under a bridge, took us through the Westside, the LSPD, through Paleto Bay and all the way back again. We met hard working citizens, criminals and the average Joe. All taking it a step at a time. It was then that we at Weazel News realized that this wasn't a story about homelessness, at least not entirely, it was a story about the heart and soul of our city. This changed the format of this story a bit from purely an opinion piece and into the world of an anthology of stories. We hope you'll bear with us a bit as we wind our way through the city a story and topic at a time. Note that whlie we did our best to cover this story there were a lot of places and stories we couldn't include otherwise this story would go on for miles just like our journey did. Keep an eye out however for a follow up piece about the state of homeless outside of the city.

While you can locate many such camps under the freeway we focused our attention on the one just Southwest of the LSPD. Where we start our story with a family of three. Mark, Jennifer, and Tommy were huddled around a makeshift camping lantern trying to stave off the cold as the snow fell around us, the weather being rather erradic recently they were doing what they could to stay warm. Mark said that he and his family had to leave their home in South Los Santos when Flecca Bank told them that they would either leave willingly or they would have the police force them out. The family had lived in the neighborhood for almost twelve years and Mark had lost his job down on the docks when there were cut backs after the economy took a dive. They lived off thier savings and the little bit of income that Jennifer was able to bring in from her work as a secretary for a small office in town however when her work too dried up they began to fall behind on their mortgage. Soon the threatening letters and phone calls started. Eventually they had to sell everything they had and left. Mark says they'd been living under the bridge for almost two years now doing what they can. He gives plasma at a local donation site twice a week spending four hours at the facility each time and walking away with only $120 for the week. Their son who was mostly keeping to himself and drawing images in the sand while we spoke did mention that he liked going to school because they offered him two meals a day which was more than what his parents received many dayd of the week. When Weazel News asked about what it would take to get him back on his feet Mark took a deep breath and said that he just didn't know. More social programs would have definitely helped but at this point he just wants a job. He doesn't own a vehicle and can't make the trip up to the "farms" as he called them. Jennifer said that the city wasn't that horrible but she did feel like the citizens looked down on her family for being down on their luck and that a little kindness would go a long way. Before we left the family Weazel News inquired about a homeless shelter for families and the parents both laughed a little and said almost in unison: "What shelter?"

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CKbsY6M.jpg" class="photo photo-right"/>With those words ringing in our ears we set out to find out the answer. First, we visited the local police department and inquired about a homeless shelter where a police officer was willing to answer our questions. He stated that he didn't believe that the homelessness was a huge deal in the city but he was unaware as a native resident of there ever being a homeless shelter in town. We followed this up to a visit to the courthouse where we poured over records going back as far as the founding of the city. We were able to uncover a couple of instances of homeless shelters started in the city but nothing in the last five decades. Astonished we left word with the Mayors office for comment but they didn't get back to us in time. We didn't want to abandon the idea that some organization had set up a shelter though so we circled the city. From the Vinewood hills and all the way back to the South Los Santos neighborhoods. We even visited the addresses registered for shelters in the past. As far as we could turn up there are no active shelters in town. Just a bordered up building and a conversion into a warehouse. We weren't sure where to go. Why hadn't the city built another homeless shelter, according to court records the homeless rate had been mostly steady and only spiked during the recent economic downturn. Certainly there was a demand for it. In order to answer this question we decided that we needed to hear the voice of the citizens. From the established businessess and all the way down to the average citizen down on the street. Here's what we heard.

We started with an established and well known business in town, Benny's Motorworks. Benny's has been around since the establishment of the city starting their efforts working on the original model T's. When we made our way to the garage we were greeted by one of the employees. Thorne Novelland, a mechanic for the shop who was happy to give us a tour of the facility and talk about what Benny's Motorworks was doing for the community. He said that the shop has a meeting place for the community for a very long time. It was a place for citizens to come hang out and socialize. Down in their basement they even have a rumpuss room with a pool table, couch, and snack machine. Mr. Novelland was also quick to point out that these facilities weren't just for the patrons that any citizen in need could come and find a helping hand and a place to sleep. The tour concluded with us asking the pressing questions about what he believed the city could do to improve the situation. He believed that things were already turning towards the better, that the economy was recovering and that there were new opportunities available every day. He was optimistic that the lack of property ownership wasn't a real concern because it was in the decline. Of the citizens Weazel News was able to speak with we hope that Benny's and their optimism remains a staple of the community and the city.

From the established icons and new enterprises in town we also spoke with some of the less reputable members of our city. At first, we'll admit Weazel News didn't expect to hear much from them but by the end we found people, real people. Some just trying to carve out a piece of the world for themselves and others just living day to day. Our first story begins with a blonde gentlemen with sunglasses who chose to remain anonymous. We first met up with him outside of the Elgin Street garage where he strongly advised that our reporter join him on his route for the day. While on this journey our intrepid reporter took the time to learn more about the citizen. He sounded like a loner who didn't have any family left. According to him he was an only child with deceased parents. He did graduate from high school but didn't attend university. He said that he didn't want a life of crime but that this was the only work he felt he could do. His opinion was that there just wasn't enough work in the city and what did exist was just not paying enough for him to cover his expenses. We also asked him what he believed the city could do to help with the homelessness and he said that "people just want to work and not work at a crappy job, besides, crime was more exciting." Our time with the blonde man took us up along the coast line where he first cleared out a 24/7, including the ATM, then to Paleto Bay where he made a deposit and finally back to Los Santos where our reporter was finally able to get away. (Be on the look out for a follow up story about the Phantom Runner and the string of robberies in the city). Once our adventure had come to a close we wanted to reach out to others in similar situations and through various contacts were able to reach out to the Sprunk Boys. A local organized gang that was operating in the city. We met up with two of their members at the Pillbox where they were more than willing to answer our questions.

We've decided to keep their identities concealed for their safety. The first gentlemen who we'll identify as Bez was happy to talk about the state of homelessness and stated that he too felt that the lack of property ownership was due to the lack of income in the city and the lack of income was directly tied to the lack of jobs available. Bez openly stated that he slept in his vehicle, a fully kitted street racer with a rather colorful paint job. His compatriate stated that he often slept in his vehicle or at the house of one of his lady friends but that he didn't think he could afford to purchase property in the city for a while yet. He also agreed that it was the lack of jobs that put them in their situation and that they didn't choose the career path they had but that it had chosen them. They both were behind the idea of the Mayor starting social programs to open homeless shelters but were concerned about an increase in taxes. Weazel News did some checking and at the time of this writing Los Santos didn't have any income or sales tax on the books. So where does this leave us?

Obviously the city of Los Santos still has some ground to cover. There are some people who make it day by day doing the hardwork necessary to keep the city going. From the police officer that adorns the bullet proof vest and holsters a weapon to fight the crime in the city to the enterprising organziations attempting to carve a piece of the economy out for themselves to help them and their families. Along the way we had the opportunity to speak with all of the walks of life in the city and we've gained a new insight into this city of ours. Will we solve the problem today? No, this reporter doesn't think so but I think if we continue to work together that as a city we can accomplish great things.
