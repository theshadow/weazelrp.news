Allegedly Opie Winston and Jaxson Teller obtained the fire truck at the south LSFD dispatch building. They proceeded to take the firetuck on a joy ride along Elgin Ave. where the LSPD proceeded to take chase. While attempting to stop the vehicle Weazel News was able to track the truck along Elgin until it reached the intersection of Vespucci Blvd. where the LSPD proceeded to shoot out the vehicles tires. It was also at this point that an unidentified officer was disabled by the use of the firetrucks water cannon. Thereafter the suspects proceeded to race further South along Elgin Ave. and then proceeded to turn West on to Innocence Blvd. from there they continued South on to Carson Ave where the vehicle was disabled and the two suspects fled on foot Eastward down Forum Drive. 

Jaxon Teller was seen entering a property and leaping into the the back alley way, Opie Winston was also seen entering into the driveway of one Arturo Campo. Then proceeding to jump over the gate and then the backyard fence into the alleyway. Quickly thereafter Cadet Jackson followed suit. It was at this time that the reporter on scene lost sight of both the suspects and the persuing cadet. Shortly there after the reporter heard three gunshots and then proceeded to make way into the alley way where he met up with the cadet on scene and the two downed suspects. From the sight the suspects appeard to have bullet wounds but were verbal and communicative. 

Two EMS, one Gia Nova and Samuel North, arrived on the scene and administered first aid. From there the two suspects were taken to the Pill Box where they recieved full medical care and then were escorted by the police to the LSPD station where they were booked and charged. When Weazel news reached out to the Officer Gold about the situation and the outcome of therin. He commented that he and the station considered the matter resolved and had no further comment.

From his perspective once he entered the alley way, he stated that he also heard gunshots and was concerned that due to the gang activity in the neighborhood that he was under attack and proceeded to flee the scene. It was further down the alley way where he ran into the Cadet who opened fire. Mr. Teller was quick to note that he and his companion were detained at the Pill Box and arrested without having their rights read. According to Mr. Teller he was able to have the charges dropped after reaching out to Alistair Blake, the lawyer of Los Santos. 

When we asked Mr. Teller about the situation and whether he felt that this was the standard that the citizens could expect from the LSPD he was quick to remark that he felt that there were good officers on the force, specifically remarking that Officer Gold was instrumental in descalating the situation and that while he felt that the cadet made an egregious error that there was definitely room for growth and improvement.

Weazel News was unable to contact Opie Winston for comment by the publishing of this article. However, like Mr. Teller Weazel News believs that this matter has been settled by all parties and considered the matter closed.
