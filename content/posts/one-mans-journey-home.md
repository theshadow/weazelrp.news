Quirky, shy, and always willing to help Arturo Campo was on a journey tod find his way home and we here at Weazel News felt it was a journey worth sharing. We first met Arturo, a thirty-six (36) year old Los Santo's native, in the tent city under the Olympic Freeway. He was sitting in a camping chair and mostly seemed just excited to speak with someone. We were on site to ask citizens under the freeway about [how being homeless](/posts/homelessness/) affected their lives and what we found was a heartwarming but sad tale. Arturo used to live in a house off of Forum Drive on the South side with his father Arturo Campo Sr. and sister Isabella Marie Campo. That all changed about two years ago when his sister started to fall ill. She was working as a server at a diner near their home when the COVID disease started to spread through the city. Not having medical insurance when she was stricken with the diesease she was bed ridden and sadly didn't recover.

He was quick to add though that she took care of him with his mother out the picture, having left when they were really young. She walked him too and from school, a special needs school near the local school campuses, made sure he did his homework and prepared meals while their father worked late nights on the dock. As they got older Arturo barely made it out of High School and took odd jobs when he could while Isabella and Campo Sr. brought in the bulk of the money for the home. Arturo said that losing his sister was very hard on him but that his father did the best he could stepping in after she passed. It was because of her sibling love that he chose to name his beloved bike after her, using a nickname he and his father used for her: "Bella". For six months after her passing the two moved forward Arturo keeping up with the chores he could around the house.

Campo Sr. started to have a persistent cough. At first they both feared that it was a resurgence of COVID in the city but after missing many days of work he decided that it was worth the expense to visit the hospital. Arturo said that the doctors didn't take long to diagnose him. X-rays of his lungs showed an advanced state of cancer that was quickly spreading. The doctors said they could try some very expensive treatments but gave him months to live. Arturo could recount that his father was coughing as they left the hospital and on the drive home, with his father sitting in the passenger seat, he could remember his father telling him "You always get me where I need to go, my very special boy." The days away from work turned into weeks and then months. It was late in December when Arturo found out that his father has passed in his sleep. Arturo didn't know what to do but he figured he would get to stay in the house that his family had lived in for nearly four decades.

First with a warning that their mortgage was behind, then with threats of foreclosure, and finally the day came. Sheriffs from the local LSPD arrived early one morning to escort Arturo from the property. The bank has made true on its threats and forclosed on the property. He was instructed that he could take what he was wearing and what he could carry and that was all. In a daze Arturo grabbed a photo of his family from the wall, his sisters locket, and his father's watch, and then left the only home he'd ever known. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xvnqbEt.jpg" class="photo photo-left" alt="Soon" title="Soon" />At first not knowing where to go or turn he tried to find a homeless shelter but Los Santo's hasn't had one in over five decades, then he tried sleeping in Legion Square, but the officers on duty would instruct him to find elsewhere to sleep. When all else failed he ended up at the tent city under the Olympic Freeway. For a while he did the best he could begging for money in Legion Square. He was going days without eating and sleeping on the ground. Eventually, when the hunger became too much, he was forced to pawn his sisters locket and then his fathers watch just so that he could purchase food. He told us that this moment in his life was the most scary, that he felt lost, and that he didn't know how to get where he needed to go. That's when he started to turn to crime.

He would help get people where they needed to go. Each morning he would stake out vehicles in the city, walking up and down the city blocks looking for the right vehicle to procure. He took to his new job as an uber driver; moving locals and citizens where they needed to go; compensated with tips. He knew even from the beginning that where he needed to go was to get his fathers house back from the bank and to do that he knew he needed a lot of money. In the beginning it was hard. He lived cheaply and spent very little. Over time though the generosity of the citizens of Los Santos began to pay off. The tip money slowly piled up. Soon he was able to stop procuring vehicles and instead purchased Bella, a 2007 green and white Faggio moped. It wasn't much but it was the start of his climb out of the pit he had fallen in to.

Endless cycles of waking up at dawn, moving people where they needed go, and then after an eighteen hour day collapsing in the tent city. He said some nights he'd have nightmares of being lost in the city and not knowing where to take someone and would wake up in a cold sweat. Arturo also let us know that it wasn't all bad that he was able to make friends along the way. He was espcially grateful for the help and generosity of the staff at the Pill Box and the LSPD. The staff at the Pill Box reportedly offered him medical care and supplies when he needed it and didn't charge him allowing him to build on his nest egg. He told us fo stories where officers of the LSPD pulled him over for moving violationss early on in his ubering career. While he was procuring vehicles he was scared of being arrested and losing everything. Some how though, they always let him off with a warning. By the end of the year, with his minimal expenses, that nest egg had grown and he'd finally earned enough to pay off the remaining balance on the mortgage note. With some help from Legit Realty and his new found friends at Weazel News he was able to strike a deal with Flecca Bank where he would pay off the outstanding principal on the loan and they would waive the interest from the time since he had vacated the property.img src="https://i.imgur.com/hNDzlW0.jpg" class="photo photo-right" alt="Welcome Home" title="Welcome Home" />Today the good son returns home and he's super excited to finally be back on his feet. He says that he looks forward to the next segment of his life and will continue to get people where they need to go just as the citizens and locals of the city helped him do the same. He doesn't know where he'll be in five years because right now he's still just trying to get settled but he thinks he might be interested in the food truck business, only time will tell. Here at Weazel News we couldn't help but notice that this story reminds us that no man is an island and that it takes many people to build a community. While Arturo did work incredibly hard to earn the money to buy back his home he didn't do it alone. It was the kindness and generosity of the citizens of Los Santos that brought him to this point and will continue to take him further. The city has become his family.
