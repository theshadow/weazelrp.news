There was a lot of demand in the city for an opportunity for those with a lead foot and a desire to have their hair blown back for the citizenry to race. That time as come as racing has come to the city of Los Santos! Yesterday, the Mayor and his staff announced that the very first track, The Hollywood Hills, was opened in the city with sanctioned races, betting, winners and losers. While there is currently only a single track the Mayor was quick to state that this was just the beginning and that citizens with a need for speed should expect more to come soon. There was even talk amongst the racers to have a Faggio themed race to really test the metal of these speed heads. Weazel News will make sure to keep you appraised of new tracks as they come out. Readers should keep their eyes pealed for fast stories from this speedy group of citizens.
