Officer Farva was able to stun Jackson using his taser while Opie was able to drive off. The two police officers gave chase and when Opie attempted to lose his followers down an alley way instead found himself stuck and proceeded to open fire upon the officers. After a brief shootout Opie was detained. Opie was sentenced to ### days in prison and Jackson was sentenced to ###.
