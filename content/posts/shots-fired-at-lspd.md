Witnesses in the area stated that they were standing near the LSPD station building when up to six shots were heard coming from the direction of the freeway. Shortly thereafter officers were dispatched and came to investigate. During their investigation a vehicle pulled up to the front of the LSPD and a one Keebo Pratt approached the reporter on site and started to share a story about the LSPD.

Mr. Pratt then made way towards his vehicle and entered it despite repeated requests from the officer. Once in the vehicle the police officer drew his weapon and warned Mr. Pratt to step out of the vehicle. When Mr. Pratt refused to comply the officer fired a single shot into the vehicle severely wounding Mr. Pratt.

Sources at the Pill Box reported that the patient made a speedy recovery after surgery to remove the bullet. When the officer, a new cadet to the Los Santos police force, who fired the shot was questioned by Weazel News, they stated that it wasn't intentional and that he chose the incorrect tool from his gear due to the confusing placement based on SOP (standard operating procedure). Weazel News reached out to Chief D. Taylor and is awaiting comment.
