It would seem that they attend the local Fight Club and duke it out in the ring. Weazel News was able to catch a fight recently and here is what we learned.</p><p>When Weazel News arrived on sight it was already late into the session. There had been several fights already and we were about to witness the last bout of the evening. Two gentlemen were in the ring. On the left was Miles and on the right was Sam. The two men were waiting for the go signal knowing that there was $5,000 on the line.</p><p>Once the promoter and announcer, Jack Riggley, dropped his arms the fight began. Each combatant moved towards the other until they were in striking range. Surprisingly to this reporter the match didn&rsquo;t take long. After a few decisive and direct blows were landed by Miles, Sam was quickly laid out on the floor. Nearby EMS technitian Joey Donuts was able to quickly administer medical attention and bring Sam back to his feet. When asked about the EMS presence on sight Joey was quick to state that he was there to ensure the safety of the citizens participating in the matches but he was not a participant. When asked about whether he was a fan he admitted that being able to watch the fights was definitely a bonus.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/59Q1x4g.jpeg alt="Weazel News reporter speaking with the onsite EMT" title="Weazel News reporter speaking with the onsite EMT" class="photo photo-right">Weazel News caught up with Sam after the match and learned that Sam had participated in four matches that evening and hadn&rsquo;t had much success. Each match has a bet and we&rsquo;re sure the reader can do the math. After the conclusion of the match and medical care Weazel News as also able to speak with Jack Meoff the founder of the fight club.</p><p>Jack was able to tell us that he started the Fight Club as a means for citizens to hash out beefs and prove their mettle in a safe and effective way that didn&rsquo;t need to include trips to the hospital or the LSPD. As this reporter looked around the dispersing crowd they were able to identify many citizens from around the city. This didn&rsquo;t seem to be a homongenous group and that many of the people were just average citizens either looking to blow off some steam or to catch a great match.</p><p>Weazel News does not condone unwarranted violence between citizens but was glad to hear that the City of Los Santos has this pressure valve for the citizen to use.</p></main><nav class=post-nav><span class=nav-prev><a href=/posts/firetruck-mayhem/>&larr; Firetruck Mayhem on Elgin Avenue</a></span>
