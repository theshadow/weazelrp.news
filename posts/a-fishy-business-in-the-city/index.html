All citizens interested in winning a cash prize were welcomed to spend two
days casting their rods and hopes into the water to try and earn the most points through catching seasonal fish that had recently and temporarily migrated into the waters
around Los Santos. To make things as fair as possible the Mayor declared that the fishing competition would be split across two days to give all citizens of all work schedules
an opportunity to participate. The first competition started early yesterday morning and reports from citizens on the scene say that the dock down on the South side of the city
was a hot spot for all walks of life where many citizens were able to set aside their differences, shoot the shit, and fish shoulder to shoulder. Later that day the Mayor
proudly announced the end of the first competition there were twenty participants with over 4,000 fish caught! Then earlier today the competition was opened again and the citizens gathered late at night to also take their chances at writing their own fishy tales of success. The results of the competition are seen below. The Mayor was quick to note that this was only the beginning under his new Citizens Events initiative. We look forward to hearing more as they come up.</p><h2 id=prizes>Prizes</h2><dl><dt>1st Place</dt><dd>$25,000</dd><dt>2nd Place</dt><dd>$15,000</dd><dt>3rd Place</dt><dd>$10,000</dd></dl><h2 id=points-breakdown>Points Breakdown</h2><h3 id=day-one>Day One</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Citizen</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Miles Baby</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Jack Mehoff</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Miles Baby</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Mike Herbert</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Dale Morris</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Crow Crafty</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Jack Rigley</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Jean Robberts</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Mice Blind</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Matt Dilly</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Thomas Anderson</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Arturo Campo</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Teddy Frank</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Humps Alot</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Mercy Chu</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Opie Winston</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Christopher Spilner</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roxanne Teller</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mercy Chu</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=day-two>Day Two</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Citizen</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mercy Chu</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Longschlong</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Anton Poo</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Aston Martin</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Trevor Lahey</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Tony Pool</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Zip Aremandanchano</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></main><nav class=post-nav><span class=nav-prev><a href=/posts/lspd-lack-of-concern-for-hostages/>&larr; LSPDs Lack of Concern for Hostages Wellbeing</a></span>
