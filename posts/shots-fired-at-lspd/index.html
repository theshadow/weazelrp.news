Witnesses in the area stated that they were standing near the LSPD station building when up to six shots were heard coming from the direction of the freeway. Shortly thereafter officers were dispatched and came to investigate. During their investigation a vehicle pulled up to the front of the LSPD and a one Keebo Pratt approached the reporter on site and started to share a story about the LSPD.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XQQB508.jpg alt="Mr. Pratt is seen unconcsious in the vehicle after the officer opened fire" title="Here Mr. Pratt is seen unconcsious in the vehicle after the officer opened fire" class="photo photo-right"> It was at this time that a cadet approached Mr. Pratt and asked him to stand down and surrender peacefully to the officers on site. Mr. Pratt then made way towards his vehicle and entered it despite repeated requests from the officer. Once in the vehicle the police officer drew his weapon and warned Mr. Pratt to step out of the vehicle. When Mr. Pratt refused to comply the officer fired a single shot into the vehicle severely wounding Mr. Pratt.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/XCWSfAu.jpg alt="Keebo Pratt about to receive medical attention from EMS" title="Keebo Pratt about to receive medical attention from EMS" class="photo photo-left"> EMS was then called onto the scene and began to administer aid to the victim. Sources at the Pill Box reported that the patient made a speedy recovery after surgery to remove the bullet. When the officer, a new cadet to the Los Santos police force, who fired the shot was questioned by Weazel News, they stated that it wasn&rsquo;t intentional and that he chose the incorrect tool from his gear due to the confusing placement based on SOP (standard operating procedure). Weazel News reached out to Chief D. Taylor and is awaiting comment.</p></main><nav class=post-nav><span class=nav-prev></span><span class=nav-next><a href=/posts/welcome-to-weazel-rp-news/>Welcome Home &rarr;</a></span></nav></article></div><script async src=//yihui.org/js/center-img.js></script><footer><div class=footer><ul class=menu><li><a href=/><span data-hover=Home>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=/contributing/><span data-hover=Contributing>Contributing</span></a></li><li><a href=/categories/><span data-hover=Categories>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=/tags/><span data-hover=Tags>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=/about/><span data-hover=About>About</span></a></li></ul><div class=copyright>Â© <a href=https://legit.weazelrp.news>Weazel News RP</a> 2021 | <a href=https://discord.legitrp.com>Discord</a></div></div></footer></body></html>
